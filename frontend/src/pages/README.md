The `pages` directory holds React components for individual routes in the application.
Each file corresponds to a page (e.g., Login, Signup, Home, Equipment, Analysis, History, Report, Documentation, DataInputPortal, UserProfile).
These components are loaded via React Router; customize them to implement your UI and logic.
